# Simple Web Server for happy trees

*******************************

Create a simple web server, using only the standard library packages of your
choice of python, go or nodejs, that does the following:

    Only accepts POST requests.

    For any request, checks the body for a json encoded object and returns a
    descriptive HTTP error code if the body does not contain a valid json
    object.
    We expect this object to look like this:  {"favoriteTree": "baobab"}

    Only accepts requests on the index URL: "/", and returns the proper HTTP
    error code if a different URL is requested.

    Runs locally on port 8000.

    For a successful request, returns a properly encoded HTML document with the
    following content:

        If "favoriteTree" was specified:
            It's nice to know that your favorite tree is a
            <value of "favoriteTree" in the POST body>!

        If not specified:
            Please tell me your favorite tree.

## Environment

If you don't have Python you can follow the instructions from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Make sure to install Python 3.x

First, create an environment.
```
$ virtualenv env
```
If you have both python 2.x and 3.x versions, use the below command.
```
$ virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 env
```
You can activate it.
```
$ source ./env/bin/activate
```
Verify the version of python with the below command.
```
$ python
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 23 2017, 16:37:01)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
When not using you can deactivate it.
```
$ deactivate
```

## Run the server

Python 3 is a requirement, it should run out of the box on the create env with:

```
$ python trees.py
```

While running the server you can run the tests with the constraints using:
```
$ python test_trees.py
```
